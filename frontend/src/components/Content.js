                        I love building projects that combine creativity, interactivity, and a bit of fun. Here are a couple Iâ€™m proud of:

                                This project was built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses the OpenRouter API to generate character descriptions. It was a fun way to learn about the OpenRouter API and how to use it in a project! It's a little slow as I am using the free model, but it works!

                                This project was built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses the Spotify API to get your top artists or albums and then generates a collage of the artists or albums. Currently, due to some API limitations, it's only configured to work for a couple of users, but I'm working on making it accessible to and usable by everyone!

                        Hello! I'm Paulina Liwanag, a software engineer currently working at JPMorgan Chase with a focus on backend development. While I've gained valuable experience building backend systems, I have a strong interest in frontend development and enjoy working with technologies like React to create engaging, user-friendly interfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy building creative side projects like this one to sharpen my skills, experiment with new tools, and bring my ideas to life.
